```{r, include = FALSE}

  collapse = TRUE,
  comment = "#>"
)
```

*Text* uses an r-package called [reticulate](https://rstudio.github.io/reticulate/) as an interface to [Python](https://www.python.org/), and the Python packages [torch](https://pytorch.org/) and [transformers](https://huggingface.co/transformers/). Reticulate normally installs these necessary packages automatically, however, if you receive errors indicating either of these packages are missing follow the instructions below.

```{r extended_installation, eval = FALSE}
library(text)

# To install the python packages torch, transformers, numpy and nltk through R, run: 
library(reticulate)
install_miniconda()

conda_install(envname = 'r-reticulate', c('torch==0.4.1', 'transformers==3.3.1', 'numpy', 'nltk'), pip = TRUE)

# Windows 10
conda_install(envname = 'r-reticulate', c('torch==0.4.1', 'transformers==3.3.1', 'numpy', 'nltk'))

```


##Checking your versions
If something isn't working right, it is a good start to examine what is installed and running on your system. For example to make sure that you have R and Python versions that are up to date. 

```{r extended_installation_checking_system, eval = FALSE}

# First check R-version and which packages that are attached and loaded.  
sessionInfo()

# Second check out python version; and make sure you at least have version 3.6.10
library(reticulate)
py_config()
```


## Issue: RStudio craches during textEmbed
After a new install/update of *text*, RStudio crashed (Abort session) when running functions that fetches word embeddings (i.e., ```textEmbedLayersOutput``` or ```textEmbed```). 

### Solution: Reinstall reticulate and r-miniconda
To solve the issue re-install reticulate (development version) and uninstall and install r-miniconda.  

Uninstall r-miniconda by removing its entire folder (which by default [in Mac] is at ```Users/YOUR_USER_NAME/Library/r-miniconda```). 

(Note that [in Mac] the Library folder is hidden, so to make it visible go to Finder and the path Users/YOUR_USER_NAME/ and press the three keys: ```COMMAND + SHIFT + .``` . Then the Library-folder should appear, and you can find and remove r-miniconda.


```{r extended_REinstallation, eval = FALSE}
library(text)

# To re-install packages start with a fresh session by restarting R and RStudio

# Install development of reticulate (might not be necessary)
devtools::install_github("rstudio/reticulate")

# After having manually removed the r-miniconda folder, install it again: 
library(reticulate)
install_miniconda()

# Subsequently re-install torch, transformers, numpy and nltk by running: 
conda_install(envname = 'r-reticulate', c('torch==0.4.1', 'transformers==3.3.1', 'numpy', 'nltk'), pip = TRUE)

```


The exact way to install these packages may differ across systems. Please see:
