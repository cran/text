\usage{
textPredict(
  model_info = NULL,
  word_embeddings = NULL,
  texts = NULL,
  x_append = NULL,
  type = NULL,
  dim_names = TRUE,
  save_model = TRUE,
  threshold = NULL,
  show_texts = FALSE,
  device = "cpu",
  participant_id = NULL,
  save_embeddings = TRUE,

  ...
)
}
\arguments{
\item{model_info}{(character or r-object) model_info has four options. 1: R model object
(e.g, saved output from textTrainRegression). 2: Link to a model stored in a github repo
(e.g, "https://github.com/CarlViggo/pretrained_swls_model/raw/main/trained_github_model_logistic.RDS").
3: Link to a model stored in a osf project (e.g, https://osf.io/8fp7v).
4: Path to a model stored locally (e.g, "path/to/your/model"). Information about some accessible models
can be found at: \href{https://r-text.org/articles/pre_trained_models.html}{r-text.org}.}

\item{word_embeddings}{(tibble) Embeddings from e.g., textEmbed(). If you're using a pre-trained model,
then texts and embeddings cannot be submitted simultaneously (default = NULL).}

\item{texts}{(character) Text to predict. If this argument is specified, then arguments "word_embeddings"
and "premade embeddings" cannot be defined (default = NULL).}

\item{x_append}{(tibble) Variables to be appended after the word embeddings (x).}

\item{type}{(character) Defines what output to give after logistic regression prediction.
Either probabilities, classifications or both are returned (default = "class".
For probabilities use "prob". For both use "class_prob").}

\item{dim_names}{(boolean) Account for specific dimension names from textEmbed()
(rather than generic names including Dim1, Dim2 etc.). If FALSE the models need to have been trained on
word embeddings created with dim_names FALSE, so that embeddings were only called Dim1, Dim2 etc.}

\item{save_model}{(boolean) The model will by default be saved in your work-directory (default = TRUE).
If the model already exists in your work-directory, it will automatically be loaded from there.}

\item{threshold}{(numeric) Determine threshold if you are using a logistic model (default = 0.5).}

\item{show_texts}{(boolean) Show texts together with predictions (default = FALSE).}

\item{device}{Name of device to use: 'cpu', 'gpu', 'gpu:k' or 'mps'/'mps:k' for MacOS, where k is a
specific device number such as 'mps:1'.}

\item{participant_id}{(list) Vector of participant-ids. Specify this for getting person level scores
(i.e., summed sentence probabilities to the person level corrected for word count). (default = NULL)}

\item{save_embeddings}{(boolean) If set to TRUE, embeddings will be saved with a unique identifier, and
will be automatically opened next time textPredict is run with the same text. (default = TRUE)}

\item{save_dir}{(character) Directory to save embeddings. (default = "wd" (i.e, work-directory))}

\item{save_name}{(character) Name of the saved embeddings (will be combined with a unique identifier).
(default = ""). Obs: If no save_name is provided, and model_info is a character, then save_name will be set
to model_info.}

\item{story_id}{(vector) Vector of story-ids. Specify this to get story level scores (i.e., summed sentence
probabilities corrected for word count). When there is both story_id and participant_id indicated, the function
returns a list including both story level and person level prediction corrected for word count. (default = NULL)}

\item{dataset_to_merge_predictions}{(R-object, tibble) Insert your data here to integrate predictions to your dataset,
(default = NULL).}

\item{previous_sentence}{If set to TRUE, word-embeddings will be averaged over the current and previous
sentence per story-id. For this, both participant-id and story-id must be specified.}

\item{...}{Setting from stats::predict can be called.}
