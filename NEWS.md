# text 0.9.03 

### New Features
- Adding option to deselect the `step_centre` and `step_scale` in training.
- Cross-validation method in `textTrainRegression()` and `textTrainRandomForrest()` have two options `cv_folds` and `validation_split`. (0.9.02)
- Better handling of `NA` in `step_naomit` in training. 
- DistilBert model works (0.9.03)

### Major changes


### Bug Fixes
- `textProjectionPlot` plots words extreme in more than just one feature (i.e., words are now plotted that satisfy, for example, *both* `plot_n_word_extreme` and `plot_n_word_frequency`). (0.9.01)
- `textTrainRegression` and `textTrainRandomForest` also have function that select the max evaluation measure results (before only minimum was selected all the time, which, e.g., was correct for rmse but not for r) (0.9.02)
- removed `id_nr` in training and predict by using workflows (0.9.02).
